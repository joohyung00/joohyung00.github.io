## About Me

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at POSTECH, working under the supervision of Professor [Name] in the Database Lab. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and database systems, with a focus on developing intelligent data management solutions that can adapt to changing workloads and optimize performance automatically.

Prior to starting my PhD, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [University Name], where I developed a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and software engineering. During my undergraduate studies, I was particularly drawn to courses on database systems and machine learning, which ultimately shaped my research direction.

## Research Focus

My current research focuses on **intelligent database optimization** and **adaptive query processing**. Specifically, I am working on:

- **Machine Learning for Query Optimization**: Developing ML-based approaches to improve query execution plans and adapt to changing data patterns
- **Adaptive Database Systems**: Creating self-tuning database systems that can automatically optimize their configuration based on workload characteristics
- **Distributed Data Processing**: Investigating efficient algorithms for processing large-scale data across distributed systems
